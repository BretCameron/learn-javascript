reset should reset tests 

on load, focus should be inside solution IDE



1. lots of points(with cool animation), levels, badges and ranks to motivate people, with posh-looking certificates of completion
2. some courses for free without signup (but signup to save your progress)
3. some courses for free but only when signedup + email confirmation
4. once got an audience and good content - some courses paid


5. topics should include React --- no one has done something like this for React before
5b. maybe also Angular, Vue, etc.


6. Progress paths like in Duolinguo

7. incorporate jasmine / enzyme for automated/random tests like codewars
